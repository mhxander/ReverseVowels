## Reversed String

### Intro

Developers are often asked to complete code challenges during job interviews.  Here's some good practice with the sort of code challenge you might encounter while interviewing for a developer role.  Youâ€™ll use JavaScript to take a given string, reverse the order of the vowels in the string, and then return the new string with reversed vowels.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, clicking the "Test" button will reveal your results.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
